# Assignment 7 
## Diabetes risk factors

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment  is to identify markers that can indicate a risc of diabetes. 
and to explore if  we can  create a short form of questions that accurately predicts diabetes or high diabetes risk through feature selection.
The dataset originally has 454 features, but based USA Institute of Diabetes Diseaes studies https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/diabetes/overview/risk-factors-type-2-diabetes where identified folowing Type 2 diabetes  risk factors:

*   Blood pressure (high)
*   Cholesterol (high)
*   Smoking
*   Family history
*   Obesity
*   Age
*   Sex
*   Race
*   Diet
*   Physical activity
*   Alcohol consumption
*   BMI
*   Household Income
*   Sleep behaviour
*   Education level
*   Mental Health
### Selected  features from BRFSS 2015
Considering the diabetes risk factors we identified the folowing relevant features in the BRFSS dataset. To interpret the columns accurately, we consulted the BRFSS 2015 Codebook to understand the questions and their context.
